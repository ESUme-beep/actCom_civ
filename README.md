# actCom_civ6adapter
A wip civ6 mod with a complementary nim program to extract runtime game data from the lua logs
Usage, either compile the nim program yourself or simply download the exe and put it in your appdata/firaxis games/civ6/Logs folder along with the empty map_data.txt file, write "cmd" in the folder adress, input "log_watcher" in the terminal and watch it go!

also you need to add the folder into your documents/path/to/civ6/mods and switch on enable tuner in the appoptions file then it just works!
In single player that is and (probably) works for hotseat.

as mentioned earlier this is VERY WIP and advice is appreciated :)
